				<h3>Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.</h3>
				<p>I was a serial hackathoner. Every 2-3 weeks during COVID, I’d spend my weekend participating in
					virtual hackathons from all over the world. Though it was exhausting to pull the occasional
					all-nighter during these weekends, I’d always find myself looking forward to the next hackathon
					event. The truth was that hackathons inspired me. Where else could you find such creative,
					out-of-the-box solutions to some of the world’s biggest problems? And the fact that these
					hackathoners can build complete apps within 24 hours astounded me. I was so enthralled by the hustle
					and bustle that I competed in over a dozen hackathons during my spring semester.</p>
				<p>My most meaningful experiences came out of these hackathons because they unfailingly show me that
					anything is truly possible. Any problem can be solved, any solution can be built, and it can be done
					within 24 hours. Free the weekend, gather an eager team, find a problem to solve; and I firmly
					believe a brilliant solution can be discovered.</p>
				<p>One hackathon hosted by Johns Hopkins was particularly memorable. I was randomly grouped with two
					talented students, and we all happened to share a personal encounter with Alzheimer’s. Out of that
					24-hr hackathon, we developed a machine learning model that can use one’s voice to predict whether
					they will develop Alzheimer’s in the future before symptoms arise. This idea is now a MassChallenge
					startup we co-founded, and we’re currently conducting our clinical validation in Sweden with the
					Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown.</p>
