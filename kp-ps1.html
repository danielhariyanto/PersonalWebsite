				<h3>What impact do you want to have on the world and why?</h3>
				<p>I believe that every individual is an expert of their own experiences. Hence, they are experts of the
					problems that they have encountered. The impact I want to have on the world is to empower as many
					individuals as I can with the right tools to solve these problems that they are the experts of. I
					come from Indonesia, where there is a lack of “practical education” in the public school system,
					especially in more rural areas. I firmly believe that learning how to code and how to build
					electronics can go a long way in empowering the youth to build solutions to problems in their local
					community.</p>
				<p>My dream is to set up a special school in Indonesia that teaches passionate young Indonesians how to
					build Arduino contraptions and how to code. If such a program succeeds, I’d like to set up a
					foundation that distributes equipment and resources to public schools all over Indonesia, allowing
					for young Indonesians even in the most rural of regions to learn to build contraptions that solve
					problems. Though such a dream might still be years in the making, I’m putting an effort to make this
					dream closer to reality. I host weekly workshops for my university, local town, and Indonesian
					community teaching interested beginners how to build Arduino projects and how to create websites
					from scratch. I am also personally investing in a school in a rural area of Indonesia, providing
					tech equipment like laptops and Wi-Fi to enhance learning.</p>
