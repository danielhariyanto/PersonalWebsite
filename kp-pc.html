				<h3>What is the latest product you’re absolutely obsessed with and why?</h3>
				<p>There’s an app in the App Store called Dimensional. I would describe it as a social media platform
					for sharing and contrasting your personality traits with others. Upon registering your account, you
					fill out various fun personality tests regarding your identity, work style, values, and romantic
					preferences. These personality traits are displayed on your profile, where you can see a summary of
					your unique traits as well as entertaining Instagram-like stories about yourself like “your most
					annoying habits”, “your greatest strengths”, “your hell”, etc.</p>
				<p>As someone who is obsessed with personality tests and self-discovery, I truly enjoyed getting to know
					myself more deeply through the app. The app’s best feature, however, is the ability for the user to
					connect with their friends and view their summaries. When my friends and I downloaded the app, we
					loved being able to contrast our similarities and differences and, more importantly, to understand
					one another’s unique perspectives and life motivations.</p>
				<p>Since high school, I’ve been obsessed with personality type tests like the MBTI and Enneagram because
					they functioned as a bridge to understand others. Learning about other personality types helped me
					recognize differences in others’ motivation and actions from my own. I can attribute my ability to
					ignite passion for a common cause or to easily clear misunderstandings from this
					“personality-learning” during high school.</p>
				<p>That is why I admire Dimensional. It’s an app that makes it simple to share your unique traits with
					others and to discover your differences. Each friend request is like constructing a “bridge of
					understanding” between two different souls. I admire the app because it succeeds in making it
					socially acceptable to share your true self with your peers. It is a different kind of social media
					app centered not around sharing fabricated posts/stories or self-glorification but about forging
					stronger and truer relationships with others. This creative idea of making a social media app based
					on personality tests might just be the simple tool for the younger generation to better understand
					one another in this increasingly globalized world.</p>
				<p>I had the opportunity to have a couple Zoom calls with the co-founders of Dimensional several months
					ago to learn about their inspiration, vision, and future plans for their app. One recommendation I
					had for them addresses the problem that an app like this, unlike other social media apps, does not
					have organic daily content that draws users to open the app every day. There isn’t that addiction
					factor that makes traditional social media apps so engaging. I suggested to push out daily stories
					similar to the “your most annoying habits”, “your greatest strengths”, “your hell” above that gives
					some interesting insight to the user (which has successfully drawn my friends to open the app). This
					idea is now incorporated into the app. A second recommendation is to have special “limited-edition”
					personality tests available for just a day for the user to fill out to discovery some unique insight
					about themself. These recommendations could hopefully drive user engagement. To make this organic
					and sustainable, an idea is to have users be able to design fun, even nonsensical, personality tests
					of their own, similar to Buzzfeed quizzes, to share with their friends.</p>
